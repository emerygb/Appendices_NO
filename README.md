# Appendices_NO 
## Appendices for my master's dissertation on the NO+ ion ground electronic state

**This file contains appendices A-F:** <br>
A: MARVEL input CSV file of transitions from literature <br>
B: MARVEL output energy state components CSV <br>
C: DUO potential interpolation output <br>
D: DUO fitting outupt to MARVEL data <br>
E: DUO fitting output to MARVEL and Jarvis 1999 data <br>
F 1-5: DUO .en, .pot, .trans, .states, and output files for fit and dipole calculated intensities <br>
<br>
Note that all DUO outputs contain the related input in the first section. 
<br>
All Exocross inputs and outputs are typical as explained in ExoCross documentation for both stick and lorentzian calculations.  <br>
